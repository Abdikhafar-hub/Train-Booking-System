Train Booking System
Overview
The Train Booking System is a relational database designed to manage and organize train operations efficiently. It provides functionality for storing data about train stations, passengers, trains, bookings, routes, and schedules. This project leverages SQLite as the database management system for simplicity and portability.

Features
Stations Management: Stores station details, including name and location.
Passenger Management: Keeps track of passenger details like name, contact information, and address.
Train Bookings: Records passenger bookings, seat allocation, travel dates, and booking status.
Route Management: Manages train routes with start and end stations, travel duration, and distance.
Schedules: Tracks train schedules with departure and arrival times.
Files
booking.sql: SQL script to define the database schema.
sample_data.sql: SQL script containing sample data for populating the database.
queries.sql: SQL script with example queries to test and interact with the database.
train_booking.db: SQLite database file created from the schema and populated with sample data.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:

SQLite: Installation Guide
VS Code (optional, but recommended) with the SQLite extension: SQLite Extension.
Steps to Set Up the Database
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd train-booking-system
Open SQLite Database:

If using VS Code:
Open the project folder in VS Code.
Use the SQLite extension to open train_booking.db.
Alternatively, open the database directly in your SQLite CLI or GUI tool.
Run the Schema:

Open booking.sql and execute the SQL commands to create the database schema.
Populate the Database:

Open sample_data.sql and execute the SQL commands to insert sample data into the tables.
Test the Database:

Use queries.sql to run example queries and verify that the database is functioning correctly.
Example Queries
Here are a few examples from the queries.sql file:

Get all trains and their capacity:

sql
Copy code
SELECT TrainName, Capacity FROM Trains;
Find passengers who booked a specific train:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.Name, b.TrainID
FROM Passengers p
JOIN Bookings b ON p.PassengerID = b.PassengerID
WHERE b.TrainID = 1;
Find available seats on a train:

sql
Copy code
SELECT t.TrainName, (t.Capacity - COUNT(b.BookingID)) AS AvailableSeats
FROM Trains t
LEFT JOIN Bookings b ON t.TrainID = b.TrainID
GROUP BY t.TrainID;
